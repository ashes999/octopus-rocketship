# Octopus RocketShip

Experimental game for my 6yo. Requirements to date:

- you control a rainbow octopus that catches different-coloured fish
- each fish you catch leaves a gem
- you can catch gems
- you can spend gems to buy a rocket ship
- the rocket ship catches gems and fish for you
- you can also buy new rocket ships and crowns with gems.

Srsly.
